# WallmartSalesForecast
In this project I took Walmart sales Dataset from kaggle and built a useful machine learning model that can predict sales with reasonable accuracy based on historic sales data. Also trained the model with two different machine learning Regressor algos namely Random forests and XGBoost Regressor.
